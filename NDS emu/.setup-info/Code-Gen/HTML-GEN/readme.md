### Put all of your file names in a list in "filenames.txt" in the folder "gen"

## Now there are a few components you may have to change:

Change the variable "countt" (in Cat.py) to the ID of ONE NUMBER BEFORE the ID of the first game you would like to generate.

```1 - 1000 = GBA

1001 - 2000 = NES

2001 - 3500 = SNES

3501 - 4500 = N64

4501 - 6000 = Gameboy

6001 - 7000 = Atari 5200

7001 - 9000 = DS

9001 - 10000 = PS1

10001 - 11000 = Sega MD
```

There is a helpful chart above to show the ID ranges for each game type. Make sure your game is within those ranges, if you'd like it to be that type.

Now make sure your all of your file names (without extensions) are in the "filenames.txt" file. Make sure there are no spaces in the file names, and that they have no ' or % or other weird characters not found in ours, then place your file in the "gen" folder.

Run the python file, copy all the text in a generated file called "gen.txt" and then delete the last line (it will be a blank line). 

You have now generated the html!
